# GTM-CoSell-Orch
GTM & Co‑Sell Orchestration Hub (PWA)
A lightweight Progressive Web App designed to help partners plan, track, and execute Microsoft‑aligned Go‑To‑Market (GTM) and co‑sell motions.
Built using real, publicly available Microsoft partner ecosystem concepts including:

Microsoft Co‑Sell Lifecycle

Azure Marketplace & AppSource GTM requirements

Microsoft Cloud Partner Program (MCPP)

Microsoft Solution Plays

Incentive & funding programs

This project demonstrates how a Partner Development Manager (PDM) can simplify complex partner motions, improve readiness, and accelerate joint execution with partners like Avanade and Accenture.

🎯 Purpose of This Project
This PWA was created to showcase:

Strategic understanding of Microsoft’s partner ecosystem

Familiarity with co‑sell motions, GTM planning, and readiness workflows

Ability to translate partner strategy into actionable tooling

Product thinking and technical execution

A practical example of how a PDM could streamline partner orchestration

It is intentionally lightweight, offline‑capable, and easy to extend — mirroring the kind of internal enablement tools that help partners move faster.
